# Collatz
A python program to run the Collatz algorithm.
The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics considered to be an extremely difficult problem to solve. It is named after Lothar Collatz, the person who introduced this idea.

The Collatz Conjecture is very simply stated and easy to understand. Take any arbitrary positive integer.
If the number is even, divide it by 2 and if the number is odd, multiply the number by 3 and add 1. Perform the same operation on the number obtained and on the numbers obtained successively. The Collatz conjecture states that all such sequences will end in the number 1. For example:

3   --> arbitrary positive integer

10  = 3 x 3 + 1

5   = 10 / 2

16  = 5 x 3 + 1

8   = 16 / 2

4   = 8 / 2

2   = 4 / 2

1   = 2 / 1
